      <li><h3>Fortnite</h3></li> 
    </ul>

        <li> It is a bad game</li>
        <li> It is full of bugs</li>
        <li> If you have a good relationship with the RNG gods then play. If not, you shall never win.</li>
      </ol>
  <ul> <li><h3>StarWars Battlefront 2</h3></li></ul>

  <ol>
    <li> First off, the heros suck. Their health is too low for what they are. (However they are putting health star cards in for every hero so it might get better).</li>
    <li> Second off, You will die alot to one shots</li>
    <li>Lag. Thats all I have to say. Just lag</li> 
    <li> Also its made by EA so...</li>
    </ol>
    <ul><li><h3>ARK Survival Evolved</h3></li></ul>

    <ol>
      <li> Good game</li>
      <li> It has good gameplay</li>
      <li> However its more fun with a friend</li>
      <li> Offical servers suck don't play them</li>
